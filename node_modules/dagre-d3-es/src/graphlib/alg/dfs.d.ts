 * A helper that preforms a pre- or post-order traversal on the input graph

 *
 * @param {Graph} g - Input graph.
 * @param {NodeID[] | NodeID} vs - Starting node or array of nodes.
 * @param {'post' | 'pre'} order - The order to use. Must be one of "pre" or "post".
 * @returns {NodeID[]} The nodes in the order they were visited.
